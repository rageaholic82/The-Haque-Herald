# Mele Kalikimaka & A Happy 2025!

As the sun sets on another year here in the islands, we wanted to take a moment to share the highlights of our 2024. It’s been a year of growth, adventure, and plenty of quality time together.

## Our Favorite Memory
If we had to pick one moment that defined the year, it was our family gathering at the beach. There’s nothing quite like the sound of the waves and the feeling of sand between your toes to remind us of what's important.

## 2024 Highlights:
* **Travel:** We explored the North Shore and finally hiked the Kalalau Trail (well, part of it!).
* **Milestones:** The kids are taller, the garden is greener, and our hearts are fuller.
* **Updates:** We’ve officially launched this digital diary to keep our mainland ohana in the loop more often.

## A Note of Gratitude
Mahalo to all our friends and family for being part of our journey this year. We are looking forward to more sunsets, more laughter, and more adventures in 2025.

With much Aloha,
*The Family*
